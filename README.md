OKE (Open Knowledge Extraction) allows to infer new relations from extracted relations. It is based on a syntactic and taxonomic implications and a set of rules to make a partial order on relations. This last one allows to compute criterias on relations (belief and specificity) to evaluate relevant relations through selection models.

MUD.py requires:
 + Python 2.7
 + CGI librairies (BaseHTTPServer et CGIHTTPServer)

#### Folders ####
  + Data
    
    +Relations -- predicate(suj, obj) --
      
      + Predicats: You need to disinguish your relations with predicates. Each predicate has its own file. Format --> #ID\tSuj_wsd\tObj_wsd\tSuj\tObj with suj_wsd disambiguised suject of the relation (resp. obj_wsd) and suj the subject of the relation (resp. obj).
    
    + Phrases: This folder has two main files. id_phrases.txt indexes your sentences --> #ID\tsentence1\r and sources.reverb indexes sources of your sentences --> #ID\tSource1|Source2\r. Finally, you have to use sources.py to count the support of each relation.
